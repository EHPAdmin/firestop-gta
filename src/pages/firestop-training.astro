            Firestop systems are an essential component of building safety and must be installed correctly to protect
            against the spread of fire, smoke, and toxic gases. The Sealant, Waterproofing, and Restoration Institute
            (SWRI) offers a comprehensive series of instructional courses for contractors, installers, and building
            owners to become certified in firestop installation and maintenance. This article will provide an overview
            of the STI Firestop Instructional Training Courses, including Firestop 101, Fit Level 1, Fit Level 2, and

            Firestop systems are highly dependent on proper design and installation for success in an actual fire. They
            are the only code required life-safety items installed by every trade. The importance of proper training
            cannot be understated to ensure that firestopping systems are installed correctly in the field.
